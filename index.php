          <h2 class="font-weight-bolder">COVID-19</h2>
          <p> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
            Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.</p>
            <p>The outbreak of this disease
               has created a global health crisis that has had a deep impact on the way 
              we perceive our world and our everyday lives. Not only
               the rate of contagion and patterns of transmission threatens our 
               sense of agency, but the safety measures put in place to contain the 
               spread of the virus also require social distancing by refraining from
                doing what is inherently human, which is to find solace in the company of others.</p>
          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">How it spreads?</h4>
          <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 is spread mainly from person-to-person, usually via close contact (within six feet). That could be via physical contact, like handshaking (if someone's hands are contaminated with the virus) or touching contaminated surfaces.</p>

          <p><em> "A sneezing or coughing person will cover their mouth, get it all over their hand, and then touch something that you then touch,"</em> Robert Murphy, MD, an infectious disease expert at Northwestern University, tells Health. The virus can then gain entry into your body when you touch your own face, he adds.</p>
